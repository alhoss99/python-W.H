Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a specific value within a sorted 
array. Here's the pseudocode, flowchart, and an explanation of how it works:







Explanation:

The algorithm starts by setting two pointers, left and right, initially pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.
It then enters a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right.
Inside the loop, the algorithm calculates the middle index, mid, by averaging left and right.
It compares the value at index mid with the target value:
If they are equal, the algorithm has found the target and returns the index.
If the value at index mid is less than the target, it means the target might be in the right half of the array, so left is updated to mid + 1.
If the value at index mid is greater than the target, it means the target might be in the left half of the array, so right is updated to mid - 1.
The loop continues until left becomes greater than right, indicating that the target is not in the array. The algorithm then returns a "not found" result.
Binary search reduces the search space by half with each iteration, making it more efficient than linear search for large sorted arrays.
